    { question: "What is the maximum number of regions you can divide a circle into using 6 straight cuts?", options: ["12","16","22","31"], answer: "22", flavour: "The lazy caterer's sequence: R(n) = (n² + n + 2)/2. For n=6: (36 + 6 + 2)/2 = 22 regions. Each new cut crosses all previous lines.", difficulty: "hard", ageMin: 16 },
    { question: "In the 'Surprise Examination' paradox, why does backward induction fail?", options: ["Because the students are too clever","Because the concept of 'surprise' is self-referential and cannot be formally captured by backward induction over a finite sequence","Because teachers always lie","Because exams are predictable"], answer: "Because the concept of 'surprise' is self-referential and cannot be formally captured by backward induction over a finite sequence", flavour: "The paradox reveals that surprise depends on epistemic states that shift during the reasoning process itself, undermining the inductive chain.", difficulty: "hard", ageMin: 17 },
    { question: "A game requires you to pick a positive integer. You win if no one else picks the same number. What does game theory suggest?", options: ["Always pick 1","Pick a random large number","Use a mixed strategy with decreasing probability on each successive integer","Always pick a prime number"], answer: "Use a mixed strategy with decreasing probability on each successive integer", flavour: "The Nash equilibrium involves a probability distribution where smaller numbers are chosen more often, balancing the trade-off between popularity and uniqueness.", difficulty: "hard", ageMin: 16 },
    { question: "What is the Braess Paradox?", options: ["Adding a new road to a traffic network can increase overall travel time for all drivers","More roads always reduce congestion","Traffic always flows optimally","Removing roads causes gridlock"], answer: "Adding a new road to a traffic network can increase overall travel time for all drivers", flavour: "Named after Dietrich Braess (1968), this counterintuitive result arises because selfish routing to the new road creates worse equilibrium for everyone.", difficulty: "hard", ageMin: 16 },
    { question: "In the 'Secretary Problem' (optimal stopping), you interview n candidates sequentially. What is the optimal strategy and what is the probability of selecting the best?", options: ["Interview all candidates, then choose","Reject the first n/e candidates (~37%), then pick the next one better than all previous — success probability converges to 1/e (~37%)","Always pick the first candidate","Pick randomly with equal probability"], answer: "Reject the first n/e candidates (~37%), then pick the next one better than all previous — success probability converges to 1/e (~37%)", flavour: "Also called the 'marriage problem', the 1/e rule is a cornerstone of optimal stopping theory. It works for any large n.", difficulty: "hard", ageMin: 17 },
    { question: "What is the Coastline Paradox?", options: ["The measured length of a coastline increases without limit as the measurement scale decreases","All coastlines are the same length","Coastlines cannot be measured","Islands have longer coastlines than continents"], answer: "The measured length of a coastline increases without limit as the measurement scale decreases", flavour: "Mandelbrot used this to develop fractal geometry. Britain's coastline is ~12,400 km at one scale but much longer at finer resolutions.", difficulty: "hard", ageMin: 16 },
    { question: "What is the Euler characteristic of a standard coffee mug?", options: ["0","1","2","-1"], answer: "0", flavour: "A coffee mug is topologically equivalent to a torus (doughnut) due to the handle's hole. The Euler characteristic V - E + F for a torus is 0, not 2 as for a sphere.", difficulty: "hard", ageMin: 17 },
    { question: "What is the Friendship Theorem in graph theory?", options: ["If any two people at a party have exactly one mutual friend, then there is one person who is everyone's friend","Everyone has at least one friend","Friendships are always reciprocal","Every graph has at least one triangle"], answer: "If any two people at a party have exactly one mutual friend, then there is one person who is everyone's friend", flavour: "Proved by Erdos, Renyi, and Sos in 1966, the only graphs satisfying this are 'windmill graphs' — triangles sharing a single common vertex.", difficulty: "hard", ageMin: 17 },
    { question: "If the Earth were shrunk to the size of a billiard ball, which would be smoother?", options: ["The billiard ball would be much smoother","The Earth would be smoother","They would be about equally smooth — Earth's mountains are tiny relative to its diameter","Neither can be compared"], answer: "They would be about equally smooth — Earth's mountains are tiny relative to its diameter", flavour: "Mount Everest (8.8 km) relative to Earth's diameter (12,742 km) is ~0.07%. A billiard ball's tolerance is ~0.22%, so Earth is within spec.", difficulty: "hard", ageMin: 16 }
